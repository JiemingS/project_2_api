# Development Process and Problem-solving Strategy

For the start, I draw a framework about my three table with the connections.

And then, start to create three table with no relationship between them. Test if all of
them is work, after that, add the relationship between them.

The Strategy I use to complete this program is trying to sepertate the big database into some small
tables, And make a planning schedule.

# Unsolved Problems

- Add more tables and some relationships which will give user more option for create data.
